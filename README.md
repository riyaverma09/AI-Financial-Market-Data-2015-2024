📊 AI Companies Financial Market Analysis (2015–2024)

🟢 Problem Statement
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a key driver of innovation and revenue for tech giants like Google (Gemini), Meta (LLaMA), and OpenAI (ChatGPT).
However, understanding how R&D investments, AI product launches, and market events influence revenue growth and stock performance remains a challenge for analysts and investors.

The problem lies in:

1.Tracking R&D expenditure vs. revenue generation over time.
2.Measuring the impact of AI launches (Gemini, LLaMA, GPT) on stock performance.
3.Identifying event-based fluctuations in the market.
4.Understanding the correlation between spending, revenue, and stock indices.

🎯 Objectives of the Analysis

Using a synthetic dataset (2015–2024), we aim to answer:

🔸How much amount did the companies spend on R&D?

🔸What was the revenue generated by the companies?

🔸What was the datewise impact of major AI events on stock performance?

🔸Which events had the maximum stock impact?

🔸How did AI revenue growth vary year by year?

🔸What are the correlations between R&D, revenue, and stock data?

🔸How does Expenditure vs. Revenue compare across years?

🔸How can event impact analysis help in predicting market sentiment?

🔸How does the financial index change with respect to year & company?


🛠 Solution Approach

We used Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for this analysis.

Steps followed:

➡️Loaded and cleaned the dataset (CSV format).

➡️Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on R&D spending, revenue, and stock prices.

➡️Conducted event-based analysis for launches of Gemini, LLaMA, and GPT.

➡️Built visualizations (line charts, bar plots, correlation heatmaps) to extract insights.

➡️Compared expenditure vs. revenue trends to understand ROI.

➡️Analyzed correlations between financial variables.

🔑 Key Insights (Findings)

🔹R&D Spending: Google and Meta consistently invested higher in R&D compared to OpenAI.

🔹Revenue Growth: A sharp increase in revenue is visible after major AI product launches.

🔹Stock Impact: Launch events (GPT, Gemini, LLaMA) caused noticeable stock fluctuations, with GPT showing the highest short-term impact.

🔹Expenditure vs Revenue: Companies that invested more in R&D showed higher long-term revenue growth.

🔹Correlation: Strong correlation observed between R&D investment and stock performance.

🔹Event Impact: Event analysis confirmed that product launches have a direct influence on market sentiment.
